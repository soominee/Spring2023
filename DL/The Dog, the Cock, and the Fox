The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox
A dog and a cock having struck up an acquaintance went out on their travels together. Nightfall found them in a forest, so the cock, flying up on a tree, perched among the branches, while the dog dozed below at the foot. As the night passed away and the day dawned, the cock, according to his custom, set up a shrill crowing.
A fox, hearing him and thinking to make a meal of him, came and stood under the tree and thus addressed him: "Thou art a good little bird and most useful to thy fellow creatures. Come down, then, that we may sing and rejoice together."
The cock replied; "Go, my good friend, to the foot of the tree, and call the church elders to toll the bell." But as the Fox went to call them, the cog jumped out in a moment, seized the fox, and made an end of him.
They who lay traps for others are often caught by their own bait.
